# DF3120 buildenv

## What is it?
This is a build toolchain and instant-setup development environment for the DF3120 picture frame from Parrot.

## Why does it exist?
Because when you can get an ARM powered picture frame that boots Linux with ZERO HARDWARE MODIFICATIONS for less than Â£15 including postage, brand new in box, why wouldn't you?

## How can I use it?
### Get it

    git clone git://github.com/Xalior/DF3120.git DF3120

### Build it

	./create

### Use it

At any point after building you can, from the parent directory...

	source ./DF3120/run
	
## Where can I find out more?
Documentation is in progress at [D's Website](http://www.rimron.co.uk/DF3120)
